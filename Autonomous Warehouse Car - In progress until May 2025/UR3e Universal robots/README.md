## Folder Structure

### 1. UR Basic Pick-and-Place Programming
This section provides instructions for performing fundamental pick-and-place operations using the UR3e robot. The content emphasizes:
- Setting up waypoints and motion paths.
- Configuring the gripper for object manipulation.
- Optimizing movement for efficiency and repeatability.

### 2. UR Basic Pick-and-Place Programming with External Trigger
This section introduces external triggers to coordinate robot actions with external devices such as sensors or buttons.
- Integration with external hardware (e.g., push buttons, light sensors).
- Configuring the robot to respond to external signals.
- Synchronization of robotic movements with external inputs.

### 3. UR Basic Pick-and-Place Programming with Color Inspection
This section integrates vision systems for advanced pick-and-place applications. The focus is on:
- Using a camera for color-based object detection.
- Programming UR3e to perform tasks based on color inspection results.
- Combining vision data with robotic motion.

## Prerequisites
- **Hardware**:
  - UR3e Robot Arm
  - External sensors (for external trigger section)
  - Vision system (e.g., RGB camera) for color inspection
- **Software**:
  - URSim (Universal Robots Simulator)
  - URCaps for gripper control and external triggers
  - Vision software compatible with the camera (if applicable)
